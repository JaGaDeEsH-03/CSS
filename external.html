<center><h1> MECHANICAL ENGINEERING</h1></center><br/>
<h3>
The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science,<br> structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (<br>CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment <br>and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others. It is <br>the branch of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of machinery.[2][3]<br>
<br>

Mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the 18th century; however, its development can be<br> traced back several thousand years around the world. In the 19th century, developments in physics led to the development of mechanical <br>engineering science. The field has continually evolved to incorporate advancements; today mechanical engineers are pursuing developments in<br> such areas as composites, mechatronics, and nanotechnology. It also overlaps with aerospace engineering, metallurgical engineering, civil <br>engineering, electrical engineering, manufacturing engineering, chemical engineering, industrial engineering, and other engineering <br>disciplines to varying amounts. Mechanical engineers may also work in the field of biomedical engineering, specifically with biomechanics,<br> transport phenomena, biomechatronics, bionanotechnology, and modelling of biological systems.<br>
