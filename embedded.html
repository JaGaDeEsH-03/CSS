<br />
Almost everything we use and rely on in our everyday lives has an electrical component â€“ from the microwave that heats up our food to the<br> computer games we play to the cell phone we use to keep in touch. Using electricity and light (photons), electrical engineers apply <br>specialized engineering skills to the design, manufacture, application, installation and operation of electrical products and systems. <br>Electrical technology can be combined with other fields of engineering, such as mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering, to <br>designing diagnostic equipment and artificial limbs. Electrical engineering offers a broad range of research in areas as diverse as <br>communications, systems control, biomedical engineering, electromagnetics, photonics, electronics and energy systems.<br>
